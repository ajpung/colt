# Introduction
A tool for predicting the age of horses based on dental images.

# Horse aging
## Introduction
There are many ways to predict the age of horses. One common method is to
look at the teeth structure and analyze their  wear and material patterning, but this
requires the aid of a professional, and has not been done via AI. Other techniques have been investigated including body characteristics (mass, size, etc.) as well as body proportions.

## Antler characteristics
Lindsay's studies have shown an increase in average antler mass as a function of
age. This is a good indicator of age, but it requires a professional to examine each
specimen. Furthermore, the curves are nonlinear and vary by region. Other characteristics include average beam length,
circumference, and tine length, but these suffer from the same issues as mass.

## Computer Vision
### BUCK
Alternatively, the NDA has provided a set of images and ratings for a number of
deer, which can be used to train a model to predict age based on images alone.
This is the method we will use in this project BUCK (Biometric Utilization of
Cervid Kontours). Images of the deer were taken from numerous websites,
publications, blog posts, videos, and tutorials from a multitude of 
institutions.

BUCK is working with a small but growing dataset. Because of this, different models
are built, compared, and optimized to find the best model for the task. The models
include 20 canned classifiers (e.g. NaiveBayes, RandomForest, etc.) amd 35
convolution neural networks (CNNs), implemented via transfer learning and ensemble
models. Each of these is built, executed, and illustrated in separate Jupyter notebooks.
The goal is to find the best model for the task, and to provide a framework for future
work in this area.

There is a statistical aspect as well. Even though we desire to build an age
prediction model with the highest possible accuracy, we also want to sanity check
our output compared to the expectations from normal people in the field. This is
achieved by statistically comparing the age estimates from informed hunters compared
with the model's "truth", which is determined by institutions mentioned above.
Results for CNN-based AOTH have been published in [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.01.662304v1).
Results for CNN-based jawbone aging have been submitted to bioRxiv. A follow-up summary publication was submitted to Machine Learning: Earth.

#### CNN
To perform its analysis, BUCK uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract
features from the images. The CNN is a type of deep learning model that is
particularly well-suited for image classification tasks. The model is trained on
a dataset of images and their corresponding age ratings, and learns to
recognize patterns in the images that are indicative of age. Once trained, the
model can be used to predict the age of new images of deer.

Images gathered from the website were sized and cropped, making sure to include the
full deer's body; non-square images were squared via cropping. The images were then
resized amd interpolated to 224x224. The images were then split into training and test
sets, with 80% of the images used for training and 20% for testing. The training
set was then augmented using random rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments
to increase the size of the training set and improve the model's performance. At
the end of the analysis, transfer learning is also consider to enhance model accuracy. 

However, image cropping is different for each analysis; AOTH utilizes square images, while
post-mortem dental analysis (PDA) utilizes rectangular images in a 2:1 format. On the website, the user is able to choose the analysis they wish to perform.
